### Project Overview

The data analysis project aims to provide insight into the analyse and track the accident across various region.By analysing various aspect of the accidental data we create a dashboard which can deeper understanding of the accidental case.

### Data Sources

Accidental Data:The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "accident.csv",containing detailed information about the accident area and the cause of the accidenmt.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://github.com/Satya-Shubham/Road-Accident-Analysis/blob/main/accident%20data.xlsb)
- Tableau -Analysis and Creating DashBoard

### Data Collection

- Date of the accident.
- Location.
- Weather Condition.
- Type of vehicle involved.
- Severity of the accident.

### Data cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling Missing data.
3. Data Cleaning and Formating.

### Exploratry Data Analysis

EDA involved  the accidental data to answer key questions, such as:

- Calculate the total number of accident and the accidental cause year on year?
- What diffrent type of vehicle involved in accidents?
- Detarmine how wheather conditions affect the likelihood or severity accidents?
- Identify the location Where accident frequtly occure?
- What is the type of road the accidents occure?

### Result

The analysis are summerized as follows:
- Systemetically exploring the data through Descriptive Statistics,Visualization and Corelation.
- To Uncover the patterns and relationship that can inform road safty Startegies and policy decision.

### Recommendations

Based on analysis,we recommend following action:
- Implement safety measures such as better signage, traffic signals, speed bumps, and improved lighting at locations identified as accident hotspots.
- Implement stricter speed control measures, such as speed cameras and more frequent patrols, in areas where speeding correlates with severe accidents.
- Enhance road safety measures during bad weather by installing weather-responsive traffic systems, increasing public awareness of weather-related dangers.
